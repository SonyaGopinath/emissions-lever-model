# üìä Emissions, Output, and Profit Simulation Model

This interactive model simulates how sustainability strategy choices affect a firm's long-term emissions, output, revenue, and profitability.

Built in **R Shiny**, it allows analysts and decision-makers to explore carbon-cost pathways under different assumptions ‚Äî including capital productivity, carbon pricing, labour degradation, and emissions intensity shifts.

## üîç What It Does

- Projects emissions, output, and revenue over a 10-year horizon  
- Models profit impacts under carbon cost assumptions  
- Allows toggling of degradation logic for emissions intensity  
- Captures the impact of declining labour productivity due to climate stress  
- Compares business-as-usual (BAU) and adjusted sustainability scenarios
